# Harvest Moon SNES Disassembly

Supported ROMS:

* Harvest Moon (USA) `md5: c9bf36a816b6d54aed79d43a6c45111a`

## Why

So, for reasons beyond even my comprehension, I decided to decompile and dissasemble this game. This was my first HM game, and it holds a huge place in my heart, even if... it kinda sucks.

## Status
The code part of the rom as been fully decompiles, but most of it has not been analyzed or understood. Theres a Bank Map that keeps track of my progress. Around 20% of Bank 80 has been at least looked around, 81 to 83 are way less advanced, and banks 84 and 85 have not been checked.

## How
Im used [DiztinGUIsh](https://github.com/IsoFrieze/DiztinGUIsh) to decompile the code. Im gonna add the other regions once this is more advanced. You can compile the code using [asar](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar) with main.asm as input.

### Audio
I find audio things hard, so I decided im not gonna dissasemble audio functions.
